                    <h3>Define</h3>
                    <p> The problem I am trying to solve is figuring out which navigation app would be best to use depending on a person's
                      needs. Some navigation services don't have all the features that a user wants, and that can be troublesome. 
                      A data-driven recommendation could help solve this, because data on what needs someone wants to fulfill when finding
                      a good navigation app could make a decision that satisfies that someone. Since there are many navigation/GPS apps to
                      choose from, I'll be comparing two of biggest ones, Waze and Google Maps. And I'm focusing on apps since people are
                      starting to use their phones a lot moreMy target audience for this is people who have a driver's license and are ages 18+.</p>
                    <h3>Prepare</h3>
                    <p>First I planned out what type of data I should collect. This included finding what features I should look for in a
                      good navigation app,Waze and Google Maps have. I also needed to find out if these apps were regularly updated.
                      To make sure that the data that is collected is clean. I made sure to get it from reliable websites (such as the
                      Waze Forums). I also had to make sure that the data was relatively recent, so any data from before 2016 was 
                      not used.</p>
